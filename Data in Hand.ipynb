    "## Data in Hand\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project I am going to be comparing the growth rate of the top 10 largest counties in Pennsylvania versus the 10 smallest counties based off of the total square miles of each county. I will be using the two data sets below where the first data set shows the growth rate and population of each county, and the second data set shows the total square miles of each county. I plan on doing this by using the matplotlib program to visualize and compare the 20 counties to get a better understanding and hopefully a clear answer to my initial question. I think this question is a viable one to ask because I wonder if counties with larger total square miles will end up growing in population faster than the ones with less total square miles. Some people may think that smaller counties will not grow as fast due to the lack of space, and the larger counties will grow faster due to the abundance of space. This question was a random one that popped into my head while thinking about what I should do for my project, but it is one that stuck with me. I first started thinking about doing the land area and population of states in the United States, but I thought I would get a more accurate reading doing counties because states cover too large of an area to get a reasonable answer."

    "# Data Analysis #1\n",
    "My first attempt in trying to see if there is a correlation between the land area and growth rate of counties in Pennsylvania involves a scatter plot that uses the Land Area of counties on the x axis, and the Growth Rate of the counties on the Y axis. If my theoretical hypothesis is correct, I would assume that the scatter plot would show a convincing trend that has the growth rate going up along with the positive correlation with land area for the Counties.\n",

    "### Reviewing Chart\n",
    "After viewing this scatter plot, I have realized that my theoretical hypothesis, for the most part, was incorrect. By looking at this chart, you can see that the counties with the lowest land area have positive growth with only four counties showing negative growth with nothing more than -2%. The chart also shows the ten counties with the largest land area which all show negative growth below -2% except for one county that grew 4.5%. At first, I thought this was very surprising because I thought that counties with more land would grow more because of all the excess space and smaller counties would grow less because of the lack of space. When I thought about why my hypothesis was wrong I came up with the idea that the smaller counties can be more populated, just more squished together. For example, Philadelphia is the most populated county in Pennsylvania with about 1,585,010 people, but the second to last county by land area with only 134.10 sq miles. This is a major city in PA and cities are always going to be more populated than rural areas because people work in the city and some even move there. There are a lot more places to live in the city than there are in a more open county that may have farmland, wooded areas, etc. Another thing this chart shows is that counties with a higher land area have negative growth, which means that not only is the county not growing in population, people are moving out of those counties.

    "# Data Analysis 2\n",
    "Using the stats.describe function I have analyzed some key information about the data that is being compared. First, looking at the Land Area column shows the average amount of land area in all 20 counties which comes out to be 679.656 sq mi. This statistic may not be useful in this analysis since I am comparing the top 10 biggest vs 10 smallest. A useful statistic is the minmax function which shows the lowest county with a land area of 130.24, and the biggest county with a land area of 1228.59. I was curious to see the growth rate difference in these two counties, so looking back at the data shows that the county with the most land area is Lycoming County with a growth rate of -3.49%, and the county with the least land area is Mountour County with a growth rate of -.5%."
